## Let's get our terminology right :white_check_mark:

<Footer />

---

## Web worker vs. Service worker

- All are "workers"
- Dedicated & Shared workers = "Web worker"
- Service worker = "Service worker"

<Footer />

---

# What are workers?

- Run scripts in another thread
- Can communicate with client app
- Kindof like a browser extension
- Sits in middle of client and server

<Footer />

---

## Not all :rose:

<img src="tweet.png" />

<Footer />

---

# Workers: Cons :thumbsdown:

- Sticky cache (Browser refresh doesn't do anything)
- No access to localStorage, some window properties, or DOM
- Little to no IE support
- Steep learning curve (i.e Webpack / Parcel)

<Footer />

---

# Workers: Pros :rocket:

- Catch offline requests\*
- Prefetching resources\*
- Handle complex UI blocking functions\*
- Push notifications
- Built in thread safety

<Footer />

---

# How to ANY worker :raising_hand:

- You can use normal JS syntax (For the most part)
- Reference a JS file or script type="text/js-worker"
- IndexedDB
- WebSockets :scream:

<Footer />

---

# How to WEB WORKER

<img src="one-worker.png" />

- Messages control communication
- postMessage & onmessage
- Can also use eventListeners('message')

<Footer />

---

# How to SERVICE WORKER

<img src="one-service.png" />

<Footer />

---

## How to SERVICE WORKER

- Uses variety of eventListeners ('install', 'fetch', 'message')
- Works off Promises
- Have lifecycle events (Causes most confusion)

<Footer />

---

## SERVICE WORKER :muscle:

- Cache API + _Intercepting Fetch_ = offline experience

### Caching Assets with Workbox & Cache API

<Title text="Sync state across tabs" />

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      <video
        style="max-width: 70%; margin-top: 15px;"
        controls
        autoplay
        loop
        muted
        src="./service-worker-vid.mp4"
      />
    `

> Workbox is a library that bakes in a set of best practices and removes the boilerplate every developer writes when working with service workers.

<Footer />

## Why Workbox?

- Precaching
- Runtime caching
- Request routing
- Background sync
- Helpful debugging

---

## Easy implementation

<img src="workbox-exm.png" />

---

## Simple and Complex Recipes

- Caching CSS / JS / Images
- Caching from multiple origins
- Offer page reload
- Provide a fallback responses (images, document, font)

---

# React :heart: Workers

<Footer />

---

# create-react-app v2

- Introduced opt-in with _Google's Workbox_ (GenerateSW)
- All static site assets are cached (cached first)
- App works offline

# CRA service-worker gotchas

- Service worker is kept in "waiting" state
- Users have to close tabs (not reload)
- "New content is available once existing tabs are closed"

<Footer />

---

# CRA notes

- App can be added to phone
- Assets have cache-first strategy
- Cached navigation requests for your HTML

## Customize workbox GenerateSW in CRA

#### Coming soon?

- Custom workbox config file [Initial Proposal](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5359)
- Sitting with changes requested [Pull request ](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5369)

<Footer />

## Can use InjectManifest without ejecting

- Gives more control (skipWaiting()) :white_check_mark:
- Use other APIs such as Web Push :white_check_mark:
- Relatively easy to add in CRA :white_check_mark:
- See references page at end

# Service Worker Notes

- Lifecycle (installing, installed, waiting, active, activated... )
- Not transparent if installation fails

---

# On to Web Workers in CRA

- Eject CRA
- Use react-app-rewired + worker-plugin
- [Pull request for Web Workers support](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5886)
